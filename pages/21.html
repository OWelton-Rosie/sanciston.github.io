        <h1> Number 21 </h1>
        <h3 style="text-align: center;"><i>17/08/2025</i></h3>
        <p>You may be asking, "Why are you doing this one out of order?", I am doing it out of order because my Grandpa wanted to do a walk with me on
        this weekend and his bus is the number 21. I met with him at Beauchamp street, in Karori. One of the nice things about Karori is that you can see
        and hear (they're quite loud) a lot of kākā from Zealandia. Grandpa told some pretty interesting stories about Karori from when he was a kid, such
        as when Karori was almost entirely gorse bush, and they would burn the Gorse in a barrel, although young Grandpa was very into fire, for some
        reason, and so somehow ended up lighting the bush on fire.
        </p>
        <p> Once we got to Kelburn, we sat down at a bakery, I had a cinnamon roll and a hot chocolate, which was quite nice. </p>
        <p> The rest of the walk was pretty uneventful as we walked out of Kelburn towards Courtney Place, where the line ends. When we got to the end of
        We went to a nice Vietnamese place called Saigon Taste, which has amazing soups. My Grandpa got the pho and I got the wonton soup.
        The soup was amazing, although there was so much that by the time I had eaten half of it I was so full I felt like I could throw up.

        <h1> Number 17 </h1>

        <p>The Number 17 goes from Wellington station, up through Brooklyn to Kowhai park. Which, now that I think about it, is similar to the 7,
        that goes from Wellington station up to Brooklyn, but then goes to Kingston. I think there is some kind of logic behind this. Like the 4
        goes from Strathmore through Kilbirnie and then to Wilton and the 14, which goes through Kilbirnie and then to Wilton, 
        but through Hataitai and Thorndon. But sometimes it make zero sense, like how the 3 goes from southern Wellington and ends at Wellington Station,
        but the 13 STARTS at Wellington station and goes to northern Wellington. 
        </p>
        <p> Anyways, enough rambling onto the 17. I walked this from Wellington Station to Kowhai Park this time, because getting to Kowhai park from 
            where I live is pretty difficult, and I like to not do a whole lot of walking before I even start the actual walk. So going from Wellington Station
            you just go down Lambton Quay and onto Willis street, where you then go up Brooklyn road, which, shockingly, goes to Brooklyn. I decided to deviate from
            the actual road and walk alongside it in the bush. Once you get to Brooklyn you get some pretty panoramic views of the harbour. Continuing up through
            Brooklyn you get to the final stretch in Kowhai Park, which is one of those really forgettable suburbs, minus the view, which was exquisite.
            And so that is the story of how I got to the famous Kowhai Park - Mitchell Street bus stop.

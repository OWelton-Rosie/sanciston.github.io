        <h1> Number 14 </h1>
        <h3 style="text-align: center;"><i>24/08/2025</i></h3>
        <p>The 14 goes from Kilbirnie to Wilton through Hatiatai and Thorndon. So, I started my walk in Kilbirnie. One of the first sights I saw in 
            Haitatai was this weird, really colourful building. Turns out it's an apartment block called the Park Mews which was designed by Roger Walker,
            who was a quite prolific architect, such as the Willis Street Village, Thorndon School and Thorndon New World (Which I passed later on this walk).
            In fact, Hataitai has a lot of very interesting buildings and also has really good views of the harbour, 
            so it was quite pleasant to walk through and I got many good photos.</p>
        <p>After Hataitai, I continued through to central Wellington, where I saw some pidgeons fighting, which was pretty entertaining. at which point I met up with my freind Willem.
        We then continued north through to Thorndon. We contiuned to Wadestown, where we got Ice Cream. I feel like I am going
        a bit insane, because in every one of these I point out the nice views of the harbour that you can see, but that is legitimately one of the best things
        about Wellington and it's what my brain goes to when I don't really have much to say about things. Up to wilton anyways to the end. THE END </p>
